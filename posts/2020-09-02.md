# Day 25

### More forces and `merge-with`
- `fule-rate`: uses `pos?` a new function but easy one
- `thrust`: /
- `engine-force`: creates a map, uses a let binding to populate one value
- `total-force`: uses `merge-with` a new function we discover, reminds me of `merge` of course

_definitions:_  
- `merg-with`: Combines common fields in maps using a function.
- `pos?`: Returns true if the parameter (a number) is greater than zero and false otherwise

You can even use `merge-with` with `merge`, [example](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/merge-with#example-55181fece4b08eb9aa0a8d3c).

It looks like it could be a good exercise to write my version of `merge-with`.
