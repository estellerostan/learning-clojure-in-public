# Day 25

3. We can generalize the `most-duis` function to handle any type of crime. Write a function `most-prevalent` which takes a file and a field name, like `:arson`, and
finds the counties where that field is most often reported, per capita.

``` clojure
(defn most-prevalent
  "Given a JSON filename of UCR crime data for a particular year and a 
   crime key, finds the counties with the most prevalence of said crime."
  [file crime]
  (->> file
       load-json
       (filter #(> (:county_population %) 0)) ;; remove counties with a population of zero 
       (sort-by #(/ (crime %) (:county_population %))) ;; sort by prevalence
       (take-last 10) ;; top ten
       (map (fn [county] ;; map county names to prevalence
              [(fips (fips-code county))
               (float ;; divide returns a fraction but we want the result of the division to determine prevalence
                (/ (crime county) (:county_population county)))
               (crime county)
               (:county_population county)]))
       (into  [])))
```

4. Write a test to verify that `most-prevalent` is correct.
