# Day 32

I didn't work yesterday but on Wednesday I left with questions about the `crash-time` function.  
To answer one: `last` is working, here is how I understood it:
- test `crash-time` with a few cases:
``` clojure
user=> (->> (atlas-v) prepare (trajectory 1) (take 8) flight crash-time) ;; 7
user=> (->> (atlas-v) prepare (trajectory 1) (take 9) flight crash-time) ;; 8
```
These are number and not map entries... So of course there is no problem here because:
``` clojure
user=> (->> (atlas-v) prepare (trajectory 1) (take 9) flight type) ;; clojure.lang.LazySeq
```
The return type of `flight` is a [lazy sequence](https://github.com/estellerostan/learning-clojure-in-public/blob/master/posts/2020-09-08.md#lazy-sequences) because it uses `take-while` as I wrote on Tuesday.
So `last` works as expected.  
To find an example where `last` wouldn't work it would be with the prepared craft (a map) with one more value added:
``` clojure
user=> (->> (atlas-v) prepare last) ;; [:velocity {:x 0, :y 463.8312116386399, :z 0}]
user=> (last {:dry-mass 50050
       :fuel-mass 69405800/253
       :time 9
       :isp 3050
       :max-fuel-rate 284450/253
       :max-thrust 4152000.0
       :position
       {:x 6378156.189409774
        :y 4174.421040129954
        :z -2.160276953695931E-14}
       :velocity
       {:x 5.328467731051285
        :y 463.8055554700301
        :z -5.400692384239828E-15}
       :hello "world"}) ;; [:velocity {:x 5.328467731051285, :y 463.8055554700301, :z -5.400692384239828E-15}]
```
The second example still returns the velocity entry when it should return hello world.
