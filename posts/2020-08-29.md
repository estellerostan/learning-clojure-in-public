# Day 21

Because I didn't study yesterday. Back to chapter 8 :rocket: 

### So you want to go to space

Yes! But first I wanted to visualize where we are launching and I wanted to learn how to use [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil):

``` clojure
(ns my.core
  (:require [quil.core :as q :include-macros true]))

(defn draw []
  (q/background 0)
  ; set camera in point [200, 200, 200]
  ; the camera looks in direction of point [0, 0, 0]
  ; \"up\" vector is [0, 0, -1]
  (q/camera 200 200 200 0 0 0 0 0 -1)
  (q/lights)
  ; transparent sphere
  (q/stroke 0 0 255 0)
  (q/fill 80 120)
  (q/sphere 100)
  ; centered elipse
  (q/ellipse-mode :radius)
  (q/ellipse 0 0 100 100) ; scaled down earth: radius of 100 instead of 6378137 
  ; draw red X axis
  (q/stroke 255 0 0)
  (q/line 0 0 0 100 0 0)
  ; draw green Y axis
  (q/stroke 0 255 0)
  (q/line 0 0 0 0 100 0)
  ; draw blue Z axis
  (q/stroke 0 0 255)
  (q/line 0 0 0 0 0 100)
  ; rocket
  (q/stroke 255 204 0)
  (q/point 100 0 0)) ; rocket coordinates are [:x 100 :y 0 :z 0]

(q/defsketch my
  :host "host"
  :size [500 500]
  :renderer :p3d
  :draw draw)
```

![](../rocket_launch.png?raw=true)  
Explanation: The rocket is the yellow dot at the end of the red axis, which is supposed to represent the x axis while the green one is the y axis and the blue one is the z axis (I wanted to add a legend but I think there is no way to display 3D text in the editor because it's a cljs canvas). 

This is was done thanks to their [online sketch editor](http://www.quil.info/sketches/show/61f81bed1ad53412ae692761fad233af24f789e06c35ca20d830120dd6281eab) and good [documentation](http://www.quil.info/api)!
