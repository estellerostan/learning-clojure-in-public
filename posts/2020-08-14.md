# Day 8

Today I started reading Chapter 7 of Clojure from the ground up

## [Chapter 7 - logistics](https://aphyr.com/posts/311-clojure-from-the-ground-up-logistics)

### `:require`
I knew about the `:as` keyword because I used it for `clojure.string` (`(:require [clojure.string :as str)`) but I learnt about `:refer` today.  
In the examples from chapter 7 I thought that it was one or the other:
``` clojure
user=> (ns user (:require [scratch.core :as c]))
user=> c/foo
user=> (ns user (:require [scratch.core :refer [foo]]))
user=> foo
```
But by reading the docs I saw that you can also write:
``` clojure
user=> (ns user (:require [clojure.string :as str :refer [trim]]))
user=> trim
user=> str/lower-case
```
Now I was wondering if in practice it's more common tu use one or the other, both at the same time and how do you choose which is better.
A quick search in the style guide I found [2 days ago](/posts/2020-08-12.md) mentions it!
It says that we should [use `:as`](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#prefer-require-over-use) and then others:
> `:require :as` over `:require :refer` over `:require :refer :all`
