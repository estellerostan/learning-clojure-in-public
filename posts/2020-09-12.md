# Day 33 

I don't have my computer so it's going to be a short post today.  

### `makes-orbit` 

Yesterday I tried to run this test, it would print
`Crashed at 982 seconds` like in the book example but
then do nothing else...
> TODO: tomorrow look at what is happening, is it like an infinite loop?

Moving on:

### Stage II
On [day 20](https://github.com/estellerostan/learning-clojure-in-public/blob/master/posts/2020-08-27.md)
I asked why `atlas-v` is a `defn` instead of a `def`.
Now that `atlas-v` takes an argument, is it the reason?
> TDOO: is it considered good practice to always define data as a function so we 
can later choose to use arguments to complete the data? Or would we use atoms instead?
