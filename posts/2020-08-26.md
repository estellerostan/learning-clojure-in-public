# Day 19

4. Write a test to verify that `most-prevalent` is correct.  
I only wrote one test to verify the prevalence calculation but maybe I could add a test to verify the shape of the data returned (vectors of [county-name, prevalence
, report-count, population])? Or is it more of a [spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec) kind of thing...
> TODO: what to test in Clojure as opposed to what to put in specs?
``` clojure
(deftest most-prevalent-test
  (testing "prevalence calculation"
   (is (= 21/27158 (get-in (most-prevalent "resources/ucr_normalized_2008.json" :arson) [0 1])))))
```
