# Day 39

I finished the debugging chapter so tomorrow I'm going to start the last (for now!) chapter on 
[polymorphism](https://aphyr.com/posts/352-clojure-from-the-ground-up-polymorphism).

### `spy`
A function like `prn` that returns its input, to track values as they flow through the `->>` macro.
``` clojure
(defn spy
  [& args]
  (apply prn args)
  (last args))
``` 
This function shows a new useful way to use `prn`, following the one from 
[yesterday](https://github.com/estellerostan/learning-clojure-in-public/blob/master/posts/2020-09-20.md). Now I wonder if there are other tricks like this to know.

> TODO: have a look at other Clojure debugging functions or even libraries, for example a 
[commment](https://aphyr.com/posts/319-clojure-from-the-ground-up-debugging#comment-1966) mentioned ` clojure.tools.trace`.
