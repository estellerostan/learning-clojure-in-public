# Day 12

Another day of Chapter 7. I stopped at FIPS data.

### `into` and `sorted-set`
I didn't quite get why `sorted-set` needed parenthesis when used with `into` because into a list, a vector or a hashset (and maybe more?) can be written as:
``` clojure
user=> (into () '(1 2 3))
(3 2 1) ;; as seen in Chapter 4, with lists items are added at the beginning
user=> (into [] '(1 2 3))
[1 2 3]
user=> (into #{} '(1 2 3))
#{1 3 2} ;; I have no idea why the order changed and the 3 comes second here
```
That was until I read the documentation and saw that `sorted-set` is a function with optional parameters (or rest parameters) and is used as 
`(sorted-set & keys)` (same with `(sorted-map & keyvals)`). Because this function returns an empty set when used without parameters, it can then be used as a 
parameter for the `into` function.  
I then noticed that the three above examples can also be written with functions:
``` clojure
user=> (into (list) '(1 2 3))
(3 2 1)
user=> (into (vector) '(1 2 3))
[1 2 3]
user=> (into (hash-set) '(1 2 3))
#{1 3 2}
user=> (into (sorted-set) '(1 2 3))
#{1 3 2} ;; use sorted-set to have the original order back
```
Why does it work?
- for `list` it is the same, it has rest parameters `(list & args)` 
- vector is different! it has multiple arrities including `(vecor)`
