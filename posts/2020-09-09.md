# Day 31 

It's happening, it's been one month that I started learning in public! :tada:

### new functions
`not`: Returns true if x is logical false, false otherwise.  
`every?`: Returns true if (pred x) is logical true for every x in coll, else false.
`last`: Return the last item in coll, in linear time.  
`max`: Returns the greatest of the nums.  
`max-keys`: Returns the x for which (k x), a number, is greatest. If there are multiple such xs, the last one is returned.

### array-map or hash-map
`crash-time` uses `last` to determine the time the rocket impacted the ground but looking at a documentation 
[example](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/last#example-542692c8c026201cdc326a2c) it seems like `last` on hasp-maps doesn't return the expected value!  
So it means that for the trajectory returned by `flight` there must be a maximum of 8 entries in the map to keep it as an array-map and maintaining order?
> TODO: tomorrow, how to check it? and how to get the last item in a hash-map?
