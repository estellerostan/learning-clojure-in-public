# Day 27

### A day off
Learning every day is good to keep pace but it can be tiring in the long run and I don't want to be burnt out from forcing myself into a fixed scheme when all it's 
going to end up achieving is to make me stop learning altogether.
It seems that Friday is a good day for my day off learning Clojure because it's been three weeks that I skipped posting.  
So I'm going to make Friday my default day off and if I work on that day then good for me but I can still take another day off during the week if I feel like I 
need to.
