# Day 30 

### `<=` or `>=`
Where the book wrote:
``` clojure
(defn above-ground?
  "Is the craft at or above the surface?"
  [craft]
  (<= 0 (altitude craft)))
```
I wrote:
``` clojure
(defn above-ground?
  "Is the craft at or above the surface?"
  [craft]
  (>= (altitude craft) 0))
```
So I'm not sure which is the most common to see but to me it seemed easier to understand and write that way. 

### lazy sequences
Both `iterate` and `take-while` return lazy sequences.
- `iterate` takes a function then an item (that can be a collection) as parameters.  
Example of a vector being passed as the second argument [here](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/iterate#example-542692cac026201cdc326b2b).
- `take-while` takes a predicate then a collection as parameters. Or if you don't pass a collection as expected you get an empty sequence back.
Example of empty collection or nil as the second argument [here](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/take-while#example-542692d5c026201cdc3270a2).
