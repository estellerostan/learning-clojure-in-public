# Day 16

## Chapter 7 exercises (1/4)

1. `most-duis` tells us about the raw number of reports, but doesnâ€™t account for differences in county population. One would naturally expect counties with more 
people to have more crime! Divide the `:driving_under_influence` of each county by its `:county_population` to find a prevalence of DUIs, and take the top ten counties
based on prevalence. How should you handle counties with a population of zero?  
- I removed counties with a population of zero as it is needed to calculate prevalence as we divide by population 

My answer:
``` clojure
(defn most-duis-prevalence
  "Given a JSON filename of UCR crime data for a particular year, finds the
  counties with the most prevalence of DUIs."
  [file]
  (->> file
       load-json
       (filter #(> (:county_population %) 0)) ;; remove counties with a population of zero 
       (sort-by #(/ (:driving_under_influence %) (:county_population %))) ;; sort by prevalence
       (take-last 10) ;; top ten
       (map (fn [county] ;; map county names to prevalence as was done with number of reports of driving under influence
              [(fips (fips-code county))
               (float ;; divide returns a fraction but we want the result of the division to determine prevalence
                (/ (:driving_under_influence county) (:county_population county)))]))
       (into  {})))
```
which gives:
``` clojure
clj::scratch.crime=> 
(most-duis-prevalence "resources/ucr_normalized_2008.json")
;; {"CO, Costilla" 0.026001835
;;  "CO, Conejos" 0.026122652
;;  "MS, Tunica" 0.04056338
;;  "WI, Menominee" 0.040935673
;;  "NC, Hyde" 0.024447488
;;  "VA, Norton" 0.031969655
;;  "NC, Ashe" 0.025449742
;;  "CO, Cheyenne" 0.026254376
;;  "CA, Inyo" 0.024500173
;;  "TX, Kenedy" 0.028132992}
```
Menominee and Tunica counties, in Wisconsin and Mississippi, have the most prevalence of drunk driving out of any counties in the 2008 Uniform Crime Reporting 
database.
Menominee having 4093 DUIs per 100 000 persons (or that the prevalence of DUIs is 0.041).  
In comparison, Los Angeles, with the most reports of drunk driving, only has a prevalence of 0.011!  

But counties with most prevalence have a small population, we are going to see how to show it and what that means tomorrow with exercise 2...
