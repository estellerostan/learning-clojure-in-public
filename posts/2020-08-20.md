# Day 14

Finished Chapter 7! The reading part, exercises are for tomorrow.

### How to organize code
- create a new namespace (`scratch.crime` here) for when code has a different purpose (dealing with DUIs)
- break down code into small functions, the smaller then better like `load-json` as it allows re-using it for two different files, and even if `fips-code` is used only 
once, it's not because code can stand on one line that you cam't write a function with it because Clojure is full of that!
- write tests before using the function `fips-code` in code to check that it works as expected
- use the REPL hand to hand with the file, it doesn't need to be one or another.
