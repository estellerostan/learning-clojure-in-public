# Day 23

### Forces

- `spherical->cartesian` instead of `spherical-to-cartesian`: first time I see this, it is two caracters instead of four in kebab case so it has a use case 
but it reminds me of thread-first macro which can be confusing when rapidly scanning a file.  
But I like that Clojure lets developers use caracters other than alphanumerical ones and even encourages it! Like the question mark character being used for 
predicates in clojure.core for `some?`.

- I got an error evaluation `gravity-force` in the REPL:

``` clojure
; Syntax error compiling
; Unable to resolve symbol: g in this context
```

Because `g` is a global var and I didn't evaluate it before.

- Then I got an other error:

``` clojure
user=> (gravity-force (atlas-v))
;  Execution error (NullPointerException) at scratch.rocket/magnitude (rocket.clj:50).
; null
[{:file "RT.java" :line 1355 :method "doubleCast" :flags [:java]}
```
But this time I don't know why...
>TODO: find out why tomorrow, am I not supposed to try to run this function like that? But from the documentation it takes a craft parameter...
