### `clj-kondo`

In my last commit for the rocket code, I noticed, thanks to `clj-kondo` that I had:
> redefined var #'scratch.rocket/engine-force

The first definition is the [old function](https://github.com/estellerostan/scratch/blob/00bdfc5416d6f7a2635c44a87d22634a7004ce38/src/scratch/rocket.clj#L119) 
and the second one is the [new function](https://github.com/estellerostan/scratch/blob/master/src/scratch/rocket.clj#L304).  
So I tried to fix it but it is quite difficult to understand how to put functions in the right order and the dependency bewteen each one, looking at the diff between 
my file and the final code in the "Review" part of chapter 8 the code moved a lot but the explanation for it makes sense.  
[This](https://github.com/estellerostan/scratch/commit/4f6f7d14d13902f7fa0899f4a9a290c94e95a77f) is my version.
