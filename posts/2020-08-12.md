# Day 6

> Posting right now the first half of today's study

Today I finished two exercises from chapter 4 and I'm going to re-read chapter 6 of Clojure from the ground up later.

## Problems:
- Write a function to find out if a string is a palindrome–that is, if it looks the same forwards and backwards.
``` clojure
user=>(defn palindrome? [x] (= x (apply str (reverse x))))
;; #'user/palindrome?
user=> (palindrome? "palindrome")
;; false
user=> (palindrome? "ava")
;; true
```

- Write your own version of filter.
> TODO:

- Find the first 100 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ….
``` clojure
;; hard to read on one line
(filter #(some? %) (map (fn [x] (if (some #(= 0 %) (map #(unchecked-remainder-int x %) (range 2 x))) nil x)) (range 2 100)))

;; so I tried my hand at formatting but I need to read more about it
user=> (filter #(some? %) 
        (map (fn [x] 
               (if (some #(= 0 %) 
                         (map #(unchecked-remainder-int x %) 
                              (range 2 x))) 
                 nil 
                 x)) 
             (range 2 100)))
```
