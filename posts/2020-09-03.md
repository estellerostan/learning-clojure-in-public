# Day 26

I spent most of my time today on the `map-values` function.

### `map-values`
- maps are sequences of key/value pairs
- `into` can convert a vector ([but not a list or asequence!](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/into#example-5858e2eae4b004d3a355e2c8)) of key/ value pairs 
into a map 

But going from:
``` clojure
user => (seq {:x 1 :y 2 :z 3})
```
to a generalized function like this:
``` clojure
user=> (defn to-vector
  "Converts a map into a vector of key/ value pairs."
  [m]
  (map (fn [pair]
         [(key pair) (val pair)])
       m))
user => (to-vector {:x 1 :y 2 :z 3}) ;; ([:x 1] [:y 2] [:z 3])
```

And from this:
``` clojure
user=> (into {} [[:x 4] [:y 5]])
```
to this:
``` clojure
user => (into {} (to-vector {:x 1 :y 2}))
;; {:x 1, :y 2}
;; TODO: how does this work? When to-vector returns a lazy-seq, not a vector... or is it?
user => (type (to-vector {:x 1 :y 2}))
;; clojure.lang.LazySeq
```

was not straightforward to me.

#### `partial`
For another example, see https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/thinking-functionally/map-with-partial.html

### Removing `nil`s from a collection
Reading the documentation examples for map, I found yet another way to do it with `identity`! This must be the more idiomatic I think.

``` clojure
user => (filter identity [nil 1 "c" nil 34])
```
