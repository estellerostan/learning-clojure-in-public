# Day 34

### `makes-orbit`

I looked at the post comments and [this one](https://aphyr.com/posts/312-clojure-from-the-ground-up-modeling#comment-1882) described the problem I had and a fix:
> apoapsis uses (map altitude trajectory) in your narrative and (map altitude (flight trajectory)) in review, and my tests were running forever

After updating my code the test result still wasn't quite like the one in the post example but I'm not sure why:
> lein test scratch.rocket-test  
Crashed at 982 seconds  
Maximum altitude 753838.039645385 meters at 590 seconds  

It's 590 seconds for me instead of 532.

### Stage II
- `cond`: A macro that works like the way the if conditional does branching. Unlike if, cond can take multiple tests and corresponding clauses.  
Definition taken from [here](https://clojurebridge.org/community-docs/docs/clojure/cond/).
I also liked [this resource](https://reshmeeauckloo.wordpress.com/2015/12/13/clojure-if-cond-case/) to understand the difference between conditional statements.
> It is like an if else statement in C#

> TODO: other conditional statements are `when-let`, `cond->`, `cond->>` and maybe `some->` from https://reshmeeauckloo.wordpress.com/2015/12/13/clojure-if-cond-case/#comment-20

- I created a `centaur-2` function which has different values that `centaur` (by fixing a typo) but I am using `centaur` to verify my code works as expected. 

- writing code by following along the exercise showed me that silly typos are difficult to spot, I'm glad I could use the exercise as a reference and see the diff
 because without it I would be stuck for quite a while as the error message was not so helpful...  
 What I wrote:
 ``` clojure
 (defn stage
  "When fuel reserves are exhausted, separate stages. Otherwise, return craft
  unchanged."
  [craft]
  (cond
    (pos? (:fuel-mass craft))
    craft
    (:nil? (:next-stage craft))
    craft
    :else
    (merge (:next-stage craft)
           (select-keys craft [:time :position :velocity]))))
 ```
 The mistake is `:nil?` which of course doesn't exist but Clojure was happy to treat it as a key and when running `lein test scratch.rocket-test` the error returned 
 was:
 ```
ERROR in (makes-orbit) (Numbers.java:1068)
Uncaught exception, not in assertion.
expected: nil
  actual: java.lang.NullPointerException: null
 at clojure.lang.Numbers.ops (Numbers.java:1068)
 ```
