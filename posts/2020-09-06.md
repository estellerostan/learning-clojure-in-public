# Day 28

### `assoc`
_definition_: Can be used to update values in a map or add new key-value pairs, returns a new map that contains the mapping of key(s) to val(s).  
example: For a map defined like this `(def c {:x 0, :y 0})` we can update x and y and add z with `(assoc c :x 1 :y 2 :z 3)`.

### `spherical->cartesian`
The author shows how to fix `cartesian->spherical` but not how to fix `spherical->cartesian` which had a problem too.  
To calculate x from shperical coordinates we need to do [x=rsinϕcosθ](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1359534351) or in Clojure code:
``` clojure
(* (:r c) (Math/sin (:phi c)) (Math/cos (:theta c)))
```
