# Day 40

The day after tomorrow instead of tomorrow but I am reading the chapter on polymorphism.

### A Simple Approach
We see an example of `condp` in this chapter. But the new things to remember are that:
- `case` uses optimizations which require that each case is a a compile-time constant
- classes like clojure.lang.PersistentVector arenâ€™t actually constant in that sense
