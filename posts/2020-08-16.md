# Day 10

Happy I made it 10 days of learning Clojure! :tada:    
Still working on Chapter 7.

### `->` or "thread-first" macro
From one of the Clojure documentation examples:
> Use of `->` (the "thread-first" macro) can help make code more readable by removing nesting. It can be especially useful when using host methods. 
It can also be useful for pulling values out of deeply-nested data structures.

### `as ->`
It was not mentionned in the chapter but I knew about the `as->` thread macro thanks to a [pull request](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/pull/217) I did for
[Athens](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens/issues/213) and it also makes code easier to read by removing nesting.

### `->>` or "thread-last" macro
In the book example it is used for [linear sequences of computation](https://aphyr.com/posts/311-clojure-from-the-ground-up-logistics#comment-1825), the author also
mentions that a good use case for it is when working in the REPL because it is easier to write than matching parens.

### `frequencies`
It made me think of [a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/i7bd9f/counting_elements/) on r/Clojure

Updated the git repository I am working on for this chapter: https://github.com/estellerostan/scratch
