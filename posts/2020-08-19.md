# Day 13

Chapter 7, nothing new. Next time, I'm going to create `src/scratch/crime.clj` and make some real work after all that preparatory work!

### FIPS data: exploratory work in the REPL
- rookie mistake, I typed all of my code in the file before realizing the REPL is perfect for this! I already know the benefits of it but I don't have yet the 
habit to use it when it makes sense...
- now I realize that the reason the book didn't mention namespaces is because everything that happened before was supposed to happen in the REPL where
pprint is available without having to reqire it :sweat_smile:
- before following the book's instructions on how to look at the structure of the data, I wanted to try by myself with the help of what we saw before in this 
Chapter, so I did:
``` clojure
user=> (first fips) ;; a map {[...]} 
user=> (second fips) ;; nill! so not the same structure as the previous file...
```
At that moment, I knew we were going to use the `:rows` value because it's where data that interests us is.

### array map vs hash map
I looked at what I thought was a hash map because they look the same when printed, but it wasn't!
``` clojure
user=> (type fips) ;; clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap
user=> (array-map) ;; {}
user=> (hash-map) ;; {}
```
I don't understand what's the difference betwen them though

### `keys`, `:myKey` and `select-keys`
- use `keys` if you want to know all the keys in a map 
- use `:myKey` if you only care about the values associated to the keys
- use `select-keys` if you want to keep the full entries
``` clojure
user=> (def data {:a 1 :b 2 :c 3})
user=> (keys data) ;; (:a :b)
user=> (:a data) ;; 1
user=> (select-keys data [:c]) ;; {:c 3}
```
