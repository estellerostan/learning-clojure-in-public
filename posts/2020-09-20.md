# Day 38

It's been three days without writing but not without studying, I've been reading the [debugging](https://aphyr.com/posts/319-clojure-from-the-ground-up-debugging) 
post. Here are my notes so far:
- `condp`: I talked about `cond` [here](https://github.com/estellerostan/learning-clojure-in-public/blob/master/posts/2020-09-13.md#stage-ii) and
[here](https://github.com/estellerostan/learning-clojure-in-public/blob/master/posts/2020-09-15.md#cond-tips), now it is time for `condp`. 
> `condp` is similar to `cond` except it takes a shared predicate (condition), instead of passing test expressions, test values are passed.

- `clojure.lang.IFn`: I dind't talk about it in my notes but I sure did run into errors that mentioned it multiple times. Clojure built-in functions, and anonymous
functions are IFns, example: `(instance? clojure.lang.IFn conj) ;; true`
- `mat-width`: Following how to debug this was interesting. On my side I had a funny way of debugging it as an alternative, `clj-kondo` showed a helpful warning 
message:
> unused biding `mat-witdth`

- `prn`: This core function was used in [Chapter 6: state](https://aphyr.com/posts/306-clojure-from-the-ground-up-state) but I never wrote about it thinking it was 
a basic function that didnt't need a mention... BUT here we are, now I know it can be really useful to debug! Example: 
``` clojure
;; from the debugging chapter
(->> segments
     ; Add the spares
     (concat (spares segments))
     ; Include a cut between each segment
     (interpose cut-size)
     ; And sum the whole shebang.
     b)))
         
user=> (use 'scratch.debugging :reload)
12 1
13 14
27 1
28 nil

CompilerException java.lang.NullPointerException, compiling:(scratch/debugging.clj:73:56) 

;; from what I know
(->> segments
         ; Add the spares
         (concat (spares segments))
         ; Include a cut between each segment
         (interpose cut-size)
         ; And sum the whole shebang.
         (reductions +))))
total inches: (12 13 27 
; Syntax error (NullPointerException) compiling at (scratch/debugging.clj:64:1).
; null
```
What I know is the `reductions` function, used in [Chapter 4](https://aphyr.com/posts/304-clojure-from-the-ground-up-sequences), I talked about it 
[here](https://github.com/estellerostan/learning-clojure-in-public/blob/master/posts/2020-08-12.md#reductions).  
Here the new approach is better because we can see the `nil` printed whereas for the second example we have to deduce it.

- (Misplaced `docstring`: in `total-wood` is a warning that I've seen before in the code from this book.)
