# Day 5

I skipped chapter 5 of Clojure from the ground up and plan to read it later. I read chapter 6 and re-read chapter 4 instead.

## [Chapter 4 - Sequences](https://aphyr.com/posts/304-clojure-from-the-ground-up-sequences)

### `iterate`
It may be obvious errors but two times I had a hard time figuring out why my code wasn't working:
- `iterate` needs a function that uses the parameter passed to that function
``` clojure
user=> (take 5 (iterate (fn [x] (str x "o")) "y"))
;; ("y" "yo" "yoo" "yooo" "yoooo")
user=> (take 5 (iterate #(str "z" "o") "y"))
;; ArityException Wrong number of args (1) passed to: user/eval1152/fn--1153  clojure.lang.AFn.throwArity (AFn.java:429)
```
- `iterate` needs an `else` value for condititions inside the user defined function
``` clojure
user=> (take 5 (iterate #((if true) % 1) 0))
;; (0 1 2 3 4)
user=> (take 5 (iterate #((if false +) % 1) 0)) ;; this is a simple case but it is tricky to debug for more complex functions
;; NullPointerException   user/eval1183/fn--1184 (form-init8002471036494492334.clj:3)
```

### Problems: 2/4

- Find the first 100 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, â€¦.  
Made some progress on this exercise but I'm still not done, what I have so far:
    - I found a method that seems to be the Clojure equivalent of the modulo operator in Java (%)
    - With that I have the logic to know if a particular number is a prime number
``` clojure
user=> (if (= 1 (unchecked-remainder-int 3 2)) 3)
;;  3
user=> (if (= 1 (unchecked-remainder-int 4 2)) 4)
;;  nil
```
