# Day 17

## Chapter 7 Exercises (2/4)

2. How do the prevalence counties compare to the original counties? Expand `most-duis` to return vectors of `[county-name, prevalence, report-count, population]`
What are the populations of the high-prevalence counties? Why do you suppose the data looks this way? If you were leading a public-health campaign to reduce drunk 
driving, would you target your intervention based on report count or prevalence? Why?

```
- Populations of the high-prevalence counties are smaller than population with the most reports: highest is 25 737 vs 9 872 263 for Los Angeles.
- I suppose the data looks this way because small populations are not a sufficient sample size to mesure prevalence.
- If I was leading a public-health campaign to reduce drunk driving, I would target my intervention based on report count instead of prevalence because
I would want to reach as much persons as possible: 45 056 for Los Angeles instead of 189 for Menominee.
