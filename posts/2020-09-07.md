# Day 29

## Flight

### `trajectory`
The original function is written like this:
``` clojure
(defn trajectory
  [dt craft]
  "Returns all future states of the craft, at dt-second intervals."
  (iterate #(step % 1) craft))
```
But the `dt` parameter isn't used so we can either remove it entirely or replace the hard coded `1` with it: 
``` clojure
(defn trajectory
  [dt craft]
  "Returns all future states of the craft, at dt-second intervals."
  (iterate #(step % dt) craft))
```
Now the paramters order is inconsistent bewteen the `step` function and this one so we can inverse them:
``` clojure
(defn trajectory
  [craft dt]
  "Returns all future states of the craft, at dt-second intervals."
  (iterate #(step % dt) craft))
```
Wait evaluating `(->> (atlas-v) prepare (trajectory 1) (take 3) pprint)` throws an exception...
So let's see what is our goal:
``` clojure
(take 3 (trajectory (prepare (atlas-v)) 1))
```
Instead of the original order:
``` clojure
user => (macroexpand '(->> (atlas-v) prepare (trajectory 1) (take 3)))
(take 3 (trajectory 1 (prepare (atlas-v))))
```
Because from the documentation: The "thread-last" macro inserts x (from `(->> x & forms)`) as the last item in the first form.
> TODO: is it even possible to have a function that takes a map as the first item in a thread last macro and conversely is it possible to have a function that 
takes a collection as the last item in a thread first macro? Maybe silly question but still worth getting my mind clear on that. My first thought is no because 
there are no examples of the `take` function being used in the thread first macro examples from the documentation...
