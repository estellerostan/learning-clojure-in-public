- `Unable to resolve symbol: unit-vector in this context`

What happens with `unit-vector` hapened yesterday for me with `stage`, at first I defined it 
[below l.152](https://github.com/estellerostan/scratch/commit/edbac4546c069e777d05044444475d3d7fb0b81a) where it is used. So to solve it I chose the only way I knew,
 the first solution:
> 1. Organize your functions so that the simple ones come first, and those that depend on them come later. Read this way, namespaces tell a story, 
progressing from smaller to bigger, more complex problems.

But the second is new to me and quite practical: 
> 2. Sometimes, ordering functions this way is impossible, or would put related ideas too far apart. In this case you can `(declare unit-vector)` near the top of the
 namespace. This tells Clojure that `unit-vector` isn’t defined yet, but it’ll come later.

This is what the [style guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#declare) has to say about it:
> Use declare to enable forward references when forward references are necessary.

That means we have to use `declare` sparingly, only where it makes sense. In the `stage` and `unit-vector` case it seems like it doesn't, at least for the author 
(but then he rearanged the functions order in his final code example: `step` is in the `Flight control` part and `step` is a bit after in the `Dynamics` part).
