# Day 7

Today I completed the last exercise of chapter 4 of Clojure from the ground up!

## Problems 4/4

- Write your own version of filter.
``` clojure
(defn my-filter [op coll] 
  (remove nil? (for [n (range (count coll))] 
    (if (op n) n))))
```
This answer was inspired by the `my-reduce` example from yesterday's study, I'm glad I'm already seeing the benefits of doing my own research alongside reading the book :smile: 

Code update from yesterday's problem:
- Find the first 100 prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, â€¦.
``` clojure
user=> (filter some?
        (map (fn [x] 
               (if (some #(= 0 %) 
                         (map #(rem x %) 
                              (range 2 x))) 
                 nil 
                 x)) 
             (range 2 100)))
```
What changed?
- I realized that I could use the`remove` function mentioned in chapter 4 (where it was used to remove strings from a collection) to remove `nil`s from a collection.
And that writing `(remove nil? col)` is better than `(filter some? col)` and even more  better than what I wrote yesterday `(filter #(some? %) col)` :joy:  
- I discovered `rem` and `mod`! That I could use (interchangeably for this problem) in place of `unchecked-remainder-int`, so now I'm not sure why 
`unchecked-remainder-int` exists... it doesn't support `bigInt`s, as shown in the docs, `Note - uses a primitive operator subject to truncation.`, 
so is its performance better than `rem`? 
> TODO: can I find out by reading the source? A quick try pointed to methods called `remainder` and `unchecked_int_remainder` but I'm not sure how to see how this
is implemented because `(source remainder)` results in `Source not found`.
``` clojure
user => (unchecked-remainder-int (bigint Long/MAX_VALUE) 2)
;; IllegalArgumentException Value out of range for int: 9223372036854775807  clojure.lang.RT.intCast (RT.java:1205)
user => (rem (bigint Long/MAX_VALUE) 2)
;; 1N
```
